Linkbucket is a free and open-source online bookmark manager focused on simplicity and minimalism. It is written in Go and React and it is totally self-hostable, so you can run your own instance.

### Warning: This software is still in progress and probably not suitable for production yet!

# History

Linkbucket Go is a full rewrite of the original [Linkbucket](https://github.com/ivan-avalos/linkbucket), written entirely in Laravel (PHP). It preserves its minimalist and basic UI. I created both Linkbuckets only as practice projects (like everything I do), and hence their poor code quality and terrible APIs. But I'm always getting slightly better at programming!
